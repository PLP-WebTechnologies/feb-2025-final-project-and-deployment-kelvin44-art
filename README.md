# Juju Maison Website

Hey there! This is my cloned version of the Maison Margiela website that I've called "Juju Maison." I built this as a practice project to improve my HTML and CSS skills.

## What is this?

Juju Maison is basically a fictional luxury-ish brand I created that offers the "luxury look" without the crazy price tags. I tried to capture that minimalist high-fashion vibe while working on my frontend skills.

## What's included

I've created a few pages so far:

- A home page (index.html) showcasing the "Dress-age" collection
- An about page explaining what Juju Maison is all about
- A contact page with support info
- I've referenced a search page in the nav but haven't built it yet

## The tech side

Nothing fancy here - just plain HTML and CSS! No JavaScript yet, but I might add some later. I used:

- Flexbox for most of the layouts
- CSS Grid for the product displays
- Media queries to make everything responsive
- Some hover effects to make it feel interactive

## Making it responsive

I added breakpoints at:
- 500px for mobile phones
- 700px for tablets

When the screen gets smaller, the layout changes:
- The side navigation links disappear
- The product grid changes from 4 columns to 2
- Text gets centered
- Some spacing adjusts to look better on smaller screens

## How to use this

1. Download all the files
2. Make sure to create an "images" folder and add your own images (or grab some placeholders)
3. Open index.html in your browser and you're good to go!

## Browser stuff

Works in all the major browsers I've tested:
- Chrome (my main development browser)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## The design choices

I went with:
- A neutral beige-ish color palette (#E6E4D0, #F0EFE9)
- Clean, minimal typography
- Lots of whitespace
- Big product images with rounded corners
- Simple black and white buttons

## Things I want to add later

- Some JavaScript to make it interactive
- Actually implement the search functionality
- Create individual product pages
- Add a shopping cart that works
- Make the login/register buttons do something

This is just a personal project I made for practice and learning. It's inspired by Maison Margiela but has no official connection to the actual brand. All content is fictional!
